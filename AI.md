# AI Usage Guide
//This document adapted from [@yijiechong13's AI.md](https://github.com/yijiechong13/ip/blob/master/AI.md)

## Week 3
- **Tool used**: ChatGPT
- **Task**: Asked ChatGPT to help brainstorm edge cases for date validation
  logic in my Java program.
  - **Prompting strategy**: Provided context about the program and what I was trying
    to achieve. Asked for a list of tricky date inputs that might break my validation.
- **Outcome**:
    - ChatGPT suggested additional edge cases (e.g. blank/null inputs) that I hadn’t thought of.
    - Helped me increase test coverage in my validation logic.
- **Time saved**: ~30–45 minutes.
- **Observations**:
    - The AI acted like a checklist, ensuring I didn’t overlook tricky inputs.
    - I still wrote and ran the actual tests myself.

## Week 4
- **Tool used**: ChatGPT
- **Task**: Asked ChatGPT for formatting my GUI code to enhance user experience.
- **Prompting strategy**: Explained the current layout and what I wanted to improve
  (e.g. better spacing, alignment).
- **Outcome**:
    - ChatGPT provided suggestions on layout adjustments and code snippets to
      implement them.
    - Implemented the suggestions, resulting in a cleaner and more user-friendly GUI.
- **Time saved**: ~45 mins-1 hour.
- **Observations**: 
    - The suggestions were practical and easy to implement, understandable so I learned some UI techniques.
    - I still had to test the GUI manually to ensure everything looked good.

## Week 6
- **Tool used**: GitHub Copilot
- **Task**: Used Copilot to help write codes for that week increments feature.
- **Prompting strategy**: Wrote descriptive comments in my code to guide Copilot on
  what I wanted to achieve.
- **Outcome**:
    - Copilot generated code snippets that I could use or adapt for my feature.
    - I reviewed and modified the generated code to fit my specific requirements.
- **Time saved**: ~1-2 hours.
- **Observations**:
    - Copilot provided a good starting point, but I had to ensure the code was
      correct and efficient.
    - It felt like pair programming with an AI, which was a unique experience.
